N-Body Force Simulation Code written in Fall 2021

A majority of the effort went into designing an easy to use code and not into computational efficiency. All code runs through a jupyter notebook which contain extensive comments on the individual parts of the code and how to use them. The animation section of the code is most likely one of the bottlenecks as in hindsight I don't believe garbage collection was enacted properly. A few sample animations of different forces have been included, all were created from within the jupyter notebook.
